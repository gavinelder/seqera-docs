This guide details how to perform best-practice analysis for protein 3D structure prediction on an AWS Batch compute environment in Platform. It includes: 

- Creating AWS Batch compute environments to run your pipeline and downstream analysis
- Adding pipelines to your workspace 
- Importing your pipeline input data
- Launching the pipeline and monitoring execution from your workspace
- Setting up a custom analysis environment with Data Studios
- Compute resource allocation guidance for proteinfold data

:::info[**Prerequisites**]
You will need the following to get started:

- [Admin](../orgs-and-teams/roles.mdx) permissions in an existing organization workspace. See [Set up your workspace](./workspace-setup.mdx) to create an organization and workspace from scratch.
- An existing AWS cloud account with access to the AWS Batch service.
- Existing access credentials with permissions to create and manage resources in your AWS account. See [IAM](../compute-envs/aws-batch.mdx#iam) for guidance to set up IAM permissions for Platform.
