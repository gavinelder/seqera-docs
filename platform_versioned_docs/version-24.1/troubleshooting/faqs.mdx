## How do I delete a large number of batch job definitions?

Platform will normally look for an existing job definition that matches your workflow requirement. If nothing matches, it will recreate it. You can use a simple bash script to clear job definitions. You can tailor this according to your needs, e.g., deregister only job definitions older than x days.

```bash
jobs=$(aws --region eu-west-1 batch describe-job-definitions | jq -r .jobDefinitions[].jobDefinitionArn)

for x in $jobs; do 
  echo "Deregister $x"; 
  sleep 0.01;  
  aws --region eu-west-1 batch deregister-job-definition --job-definition $x; 
done
```
